# Symon's Home Assistant
This repo tracks major config used to manage Symon's Tesla car and battery using home assistant. 

Please see the wiki for detailed guidance, the files in this repo generally can't just be imported into your own configuration without modification as this is all custom, rather than an add-or or integration for Home Assistant. If i was better at writing Python maybe a custom integration could have been built instead.
